# Update DOCUMENTATION.md

Please update `DOCUMENTATION.md` in the project root with **recent changes**.

## Format:

`DOCUMENTATION.md` follows the syntax from `~/.claude/rules/syntax.md`:

- No YAML frontmatter
- First line: `# [Project Name] - Documentation`
- Second line: `+doc:documentation +project:<slug>`
- No emojis
- Changes as entries with:
  - Date or context
  - What changed
  - Why it was done
  - Follow-up notes or open questions

## What to Document:

- Meaningful changes (not every line)
- Architecture decisions
- Breaking changes
- New features/components
- Important bug fixes
- Configuration changes

## Style:

- **Concise but meaningful**: Enough detail to understand decisions later
- **Not too granular**: No line-by-line changelog
- **Provide context**: Why was a decision made?

Please update DOCUMENTATION.md with relevant changes now.
