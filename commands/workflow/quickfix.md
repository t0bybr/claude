# Quick Fix Mode

I want to make a **quick fix** or small change that **doesn't need extensive planning**.

## Quick Fix Rules:

- **No PLANNING.md required** - bypass hooks
- **Fast Mode**: Focused, concise solution without lengthy explanations
- **No DOCUMENTATION.md update** needed (unless explicitly requested)
- Direct workflow: Understand problem → Implement fix → Done

## Use Cases:

- Typo fixes
- Small bug fixes (1-2 files)
- Minor refactorings
- Config adjustments
- Test file creation/updates

## Note:

If the fix becomes more complex (>3 files, breaking changes, major architecture decisions), **stop** and suggest switching to `/feature` workflow.

Let's get started with the fix!
