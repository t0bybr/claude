# Exploration & Prototyping Mode

I want to **try something out, prototype, or explore**.

## Exploration Rules:

- **No PLANNING.md** needed - bypass hooks
- **No permanent documentation** - no DOCUMENTATION.md updates
- **Fast Mode**: Brief, focused, experimental
- **Learning Mode optional**: If explicitly asked "Why does X work?", explain briefly

## Use Cases:

- Try out new library/tool
- Quick prototypes / proof-of-concepts
- Experiments with algorithms/patterns
- Test setups
- "What happens if..." questions

## Cleanup:

After exploration:
- Temporary files can be deleted
- If experiment was successful and should go to production → restart with `/feature`

Let's start exploring!
